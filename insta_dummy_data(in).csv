Everything tasted amazing ?? It’s the kind of spot you immediately want to come back to ??

We (uncle Paul??) ordered:
Sweet and sour cucumber salad
Green onion pancake
Pork soup dumplings
Pork with crab soup dumplings
Pan fried pork buns
Pork and shrimp boiled dumplings
Pork wonton
Dan Dan noodles
Egg fried rice
Banana naan bread

The soup dumplings were rich, the buns were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside, and the noodles had just the right kick!! My fav was the pork buns!

If dumplings are your love language, add this Berkeley spot to your list ASAP ????"
